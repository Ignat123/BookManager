  puzles_f_s: "Despite the involvement of puzzles, they told us the decision of the soul at the very beginning of the level - for example, in the third shower
I asked to create as much noise as possible. And as at the level of only 3 items make noise, it was easy to guess that
we need to push them exactly.
Unfortunately, as I said, almost no one has read the dialogue, so almost all levels took place at random."

The original diary which belonged to the big role - he had to be filled, depending on the
selected items at a level that had been unique. Filling the diary reveals to the player's life story
character. So for example, by women's shoes on the first level in the diary recording was that the character was in his lifetime
girl. But the selection of women's shoes permanently banned male tie selection. And then, depending on the choice of
the first level was based on the second generation of objects. In theory."
